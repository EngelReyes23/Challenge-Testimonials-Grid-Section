									“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
									code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help
									me learn programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll
									by a former student of theirs who can only say wonderful
									things about the program. The entire curriculum and staff did
									not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never had to
									wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in
									particular, was outstanding. It took my learning to the next
									level in a way that no tutorial could ever have. In fact, I’ve
									often referred to it during interviews as an example of my
									developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
									full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100%
									recommend! ”
